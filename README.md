# spring-ui-scope-onAttach

This project demonstrates an issue with spring look ups of UIScope components during the onAttach() method when using F5 or browser refresh button.

When you run this application there will be a single instance of AboutView, SimpleUIScopeService, and HellowWorldView objects created. 
You can switch back and forth between the views without a new instance being create. 
This is the expected behavior because we added UIScope annotation to the components. 
The issue is when you select the about view and then use the browsers refresh button or press f5 key. 
You will notice each refresh will generate a new SimpleUIScopeService. (check stdout) 

This is unexpected because the SimpleUIScopeService is also a UIScope component. 
Also at this point if you then click back to HelloWorldView a new instance of that class will be created.

Note:
* AboutView has an onAttach method and in that method does a lookup via ApplicationContext.getBean() for SimpleUIScopeService.
* Each class logs when the constructor is called in stdout.

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different 
IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/spring-ui-scope-onattach-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses
  [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/docs/components/app-layout).
- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `frontend/` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
- `themes` folder in `frontend/` contains the custom CSS styles.
